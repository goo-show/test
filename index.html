  <p>
    Every day, life becomes more unbearable. Bombs fall endlessly, and hunger shows no mercy.<br><br>
    My name is Khaled, and Iâ€™m a father of five beautiful children. When the war began, I had no choice but to send my family to Egypt for safety. I stayed behind in Gaza â€” alone, jobless, homeless, and trapped.<br><br>
    My children ask about me every day. I miss them with every beat of my heart. I donâ€™t know if I will ever see them again, but I cling to hope.<br><br>
    We are enduring unimaginable suffering â€” destroyed homes, empty stores, no clean water, and very little food. Those who survive the bombs still face death from starvation or despair.<br><br>
    My dream is simple: to be reunited with my children, to start a new life where they can be safe and smile again.<br><br>
    I am asking for your help not just for myself, but for my children. I want to feel like a father again â€” to provide for them, to protect them, to give them a future.<br><br>
    Please donâ€™t leave us behind. Your support means everything. Every donation is a step closer to life.<br><br>
    If youâ€™d like to reach out or send a message, you can contact me using the form or WhatsApp number below. Your presence gives us strength. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
